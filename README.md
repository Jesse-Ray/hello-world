# hello-world
first repository

Howdy, 
I have recently picked up programming again. 
Though I have some familiarity with the languange I am far from where I know I can be. 
My main interests are MaaS and Industry 4.0. 
I am here to learn programming to strengthen my personal knowledge and knowledge of the key softwares used in Industry 4.0.
Cheers, Jesse Ray
